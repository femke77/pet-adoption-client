        Are you looking to welcome a new four-legged friend into your family? We
        have adoptable puppies, dogs, cats and kittens looking for forever
        homes. Our adoption process is quick and easy, and it's tailored to find
        a great fit for your family. You don't even have to specify a particular
        animal when beginning the process – we are here to help.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-3 mt-4 text-lg'>
        If you are interested in a specific animal, please be sure to list their
        names on your questionnaire. If you can’t find their name, don’t worry:
        simply write in the notes who you might be interested in. You can write
        multiple animals into a single application; no need to apply multiple
        times. Please note that submitting a questionnaire is the first step in
        our process and does not guarantee adoption of a particular dog or cat.
        Contact us if you have any questions.
